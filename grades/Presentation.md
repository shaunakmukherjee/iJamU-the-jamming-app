---------------------------------------------
**Group: 18**

### Attendance: anyone missing?

### Overview of project: clearly explained and understandable?

Good.

### Demo: clear?

Sketches of main app screens - behind compared to other groups.

### Architecture explained? General structure of code at this point explained?

A not very clear explanation of standard Django architecture, too much fuzz.

**-5 points**


### Presentation organization, both in terms of logistics and quality of slides, properly taking turns, demo going smoothly, etc.

Method to calculate rating was not so clear.

**-3 points**

### Project comments we noticed during presentation:

Privacy issue howing user - don't show actual address.  Also need to fuzz the location to some degree.

You are quite a bit behind other groups as you probably noticed in the other presentations.
