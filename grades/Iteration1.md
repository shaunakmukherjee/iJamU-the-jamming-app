# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 18

**Evaluator: [Smith, Scott](mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Positive Points:

* You have a good idea that is generally well-explained.

## Things to Improve:

* Your use-cases for alternate paths were a bit hard for me to figure out since you did not use the book format (see link in assignment) 

*-2 points*

* The algorithm for computing skill doesn't fully add up (the inputs don't seem to be enough to gauge skill); see suggestions below.

### UI Sketches

* Awesome!

### Architecture

* You didn't mention your front-end architecture proposal.

*-3 points*

## Suggestions:

* We discussed the idea of having users directly rate ability of the people they jam with, so over time users will stabilize on their correct ability.  What you propose may not work out as users are not directly rating ability of others, just "like"-ing them kind of thing.  

* You might think about a multi-category rating system: musical skills / reliability / personality.  The wizard musician who is an obnoxoius drunken stoner showing up halfway into every rehearsal may be great or horrible to different groups depending on what matters.

* Having a message along with a connection request would be a nice feature - similar to LinkedIn etc.

## Overall:

Jammin'!
