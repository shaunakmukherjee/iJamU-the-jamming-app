## ITERATION 1

### Vision Statement
>In this project, we will be attempting to build a service that will allow musicians to interact, collaborate and basically, produce music together. The whole concept of 'jamming' will be redefined, as interested people can view profiles of prospective collaborators, and select who they want to have. There might yet be a parameter as to define how 'good' the musician/group is and how frequently they collaborate, also depending on ‘endorsements’ that users might give and ‘recommendations’ users might write. We would preferably want this to have an on-campus geography initially, but it will cover almost all bases when it comes to genres and/or instruments played.

### Features List
- New users can __sign up__ to the service, giving their details
- Existing users need to **log in** through a specific username and password generated by them during the signup
- User can indicate whether they are :
    - Musicians searching for a band
    - Band searching for a musician
- User can filter jammers according to : 
     - instrument/s played
     - genre of music most comfortable with
     - geography/region
     - most "popular" (based on previous user ratings)
     - skill (based on ratings/endorsements)
- User can indicate interest on a jammer
      - Accept
      - Reject
- Chat service between connected users
      - Basically, a messenger system to connect users who've "liked" each other
- Endorsements
      - Users can endorse a jammer's profile, or his/her skill in a particular instrument/genre/vocals
- Recommendations
      - User can recommend (write review) a musician
