## ITERATION 4

### Contents
1. Master
2. Frontend-Main (check the branch for details)
3. Testcases


### Details of work accomplished

The Master file here contains the complete buildable code for the app, which consists of the entire back-end functionality. 
Running it will show the : 

1. "Profile" page which, as of now, shows the bereft details of a couple of users.
2. "Search" page where we search for the best match. The pseudocode of the updated algorithm is enclosed, which will be enclosed with the backend in the next iterations.
3. Django has an in-built messaging app which will be used for messaging the already-made connections.
4. Full database functionality through DBLite.

The frontend-main branch contains the code for the frontend, which contains all the Python codes for two modules : Login and Dashboard, both of which use Django's authentication framework. The screenshots have also been attached for the graders' benefit. Also, since it cannot be "tested" per se, it has been included in another branch.

The frontend is exectuable in a stand-alone manner, but remains to be integrated with the backend to make the complete app.

Also, test cases have been written for the backend, gauging over quite a progressive coverage.

The Aux contains all the auxiliary, previous files used in the iterations preceding this. They've been kept for the sake of coverage.
